  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>Many Scheme implementations have keyword arguments, but they
  have not been widely standardized. This SRFI defines the macros
  <code>lambda/kw</code> and <code>call/kw</code>. They can be used
  identically in every major implementation currently in use,
  making it safe to use keyword arguments in portable code. The
  macros expand to native keyword arguments in Schemes that have
  them, letting programmers mix portable code and
  implementation-specific code.</p>
  <h2 id="_withdrawal_notice">Withdrawal notice</h2>
  <p>After long and careful exploration of keyword argument systems
  on this SRFI's mailing list, the SRFI itself is being
  withdrawn.</p>
  <p>While the specification presented in this SRFI accomplishes
  its goal of portable keyword arguments, and could be used as-is,
  we were ultimately not satisfied with how it meshes with the rest
  of Scheme and with Lisp tradition. The keyword call syntax
  presented here is very unorthodox, wrapping keyword arguments in
  a sublist at the end of each procedure call. This is unlike every
  other Lisp dialect out there, all of which splice keyword
  arguments into the same argument list as ordinary positional
  arguments.</p>
  <p>We also could not find a reasonable way to get rid of the
  <code>call/kw</code> prefix required in portable code at the
  start of each keyword procedure call. Several Schemers on the
  mailing list perceived this prefix as too heavy a requirement for
  all keyword calls. This would also most likely preclude SRFI 177
  from being included in the Large Edition of the R<sup>7</sup>RS
  language. Prefixes shorter than <code>call/kw</code> were tried,
  but were found to be a bit cryptic while not solving the
  fundamental problem.</p>

  <h2 id="_rationale">Rationale</h2>
  <h3 id="_why_keywords">Why keywords?</h3>
  <p>Keyword arguments are a very useful tool for managing
  complexity as programs grow. They are a natural solution to the
  "no, wait, this procedure still needs another argument" problem
  which is almost guaranteed to pop up many times over the lifetime
  of any non-trivial program. Humans simply cannot plan years ahead
  at this level of detail, and adding keyword arguments as an
  afterthought is less objectionable than accumulating long lists
  of optional positional arguments or refactoring central APIs
  every few years when third-party code depends on them.</p>
  <p>While the same information can be passed using records,
  keyword arguments are more convenient for simple jobs since a
  separate record type does not have to be defined for each
  procedure taking them. They are also less verbose at the call
  site since an extra <code>make-foo-record</code> call is not
  needed.</p>
  <h3 id="_standardization">Standardization</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Common Lisp (1994) has standard keyword arguments defined
      with <code>(lambda (foo &amp;key bar) ...)</code> and
      supplied with <code>:bar</code> syntax. This has influenced
      some Scheme implementations.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>DSSSL (1996) is R<sup>4</sup>RS with some extensions, one
      of them being keyword arguments defined with <code>(lambda
      (foo #!key bar) ...​)</code> and supplied with
      <code>bar:</code> syntax.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>SRFI 88: <em>Keyword objects</em> (2007) is implemented in
      Gambit Scheme and based on the DSSSL keyword syntax.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>SRFI 89: <em>Optional positional and named parameters</em>
      (2007) specifies <code>define*</code> and
      <code>lambda*</code>, which can handle positional, optional,
      rest and keyword arguments. The result approaches the
      capabilities of Common Lisp function definitions, but also
      their complexity. Keywords use SRFI 88 syntax.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="_scheme_implementations_with_native_keywords">Scheme
  implementations with native keywords</h3>
  <p>These syntaxes work with the default settings of each Scheme
  at the time of writing. A couple of them optionally support an
  alternative read syntax for keywords.</p>

  <h3 id="_the_let_keywords_emulation_library">The
  <code>let-keywords</code> emulation library</h3>
  <p>Chibi-Scheme comes with a <code>let-keywords</code> macro in
  the <code>(chibi optional)</code> library. Chibi does not have
  special read syntax for keywords: quoted symbols are used to the
  same effect. Chibi does not offer a keyword-aware version of
  <strong>lambda</strong> or <strong>define</strong>. Instead, an
  ordinary procedure is defined with a rest argument to stand in
  for the keywords part. The rest argument is then destructured
  using <code>let-keywords</code> within the procedure body,
  effectively unpacking it like a traditional Lisp <a href=
  "http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/26_glo_p.htm#property_list">
  <em>property list</em></a> (plist).</p>
  <h3 id="_a_portable_approach">A portable approach</h3>
  <h4 id="_procedure_calls">Procedure calls</h4>
  <p>From the above table of native keywords it is clear that there
  is no portable syntax to supply keyword arguments in a procedure
  call. While all of the implementations support the syntax
  <code>(proc arg1 arg2 #:key3 arg3 #:key4 arg4)</code> with the
  keys in any order, the keyword prefix or suffix <code>#:</code>
  varies. On the other hand the implementations all have a
  low-level macro system, as well as procedures to turn symbols
  into keywords. Hence the easiest portable approach is to provide
  a macro that lets the caller use ordinary symbols instead of
  keywords for the read syntax. The symbols are then converted into
  the implementation’s native keyword syntax by the macro. The
  <code>call/kw</code> procedure in this SRFI implements this
  pattern.</p>
  <h4 id="_procedure_definitions">Procedure definitions</h4>
  <p>The next problem is how to define procedures that take keyword
  arguments. Portable code cannot use any syntax that requires
  keyword objects in the lambda list, since as noted above there is
  no portable representation. Here too we need to use symbols in
  place of keywords. For most of the implementations with native
  keywords, we need to insert the constant <code>#!key</code> or
  <code>#:key</code> into the lambda list. This turns out to be
  trivially easy in all of them. For a few implementations, we need
  to turn each keyword symbol <code>bar</code> into <code>(bar
  #f)</code> to ensure that the default value is <code>#f</code>
  instead of undefined. Finally, Racket requires an exotic syntax
  <code>#:bar (bar #f)</code> where the keyword’s name appears
  twice (once as a keyword and again as a symbol). This is easy to
  code as well.</p>
  <h4 id="_keywords_as_objects_vs_syntactic_markers">Keywords as
  objects vs syntactic markers</h4>
  <p>Most Scheme implementations with keywords follow Common Lisp's
  approach and treat them as symbol-like objects. Kawa and Racket
  take another approach, and treat (unquoted) keywords as syntactic
  markers signifying a keyword argument inside a procedure call. In
  these dialects of Scheme, it is a syntax error to have an
  unquoted keyword in source code apart from valid locations inside
  a procedure call. If we write our macros to expand into an
  ordinary procedure call in these Schemes, we can use keywords as
  markers without a problem.</p>
  <h4 id="_emulating_keywords_in_schemes_that_don_t_have_them">
  Emulating keywords in Schemes that don’t have them</h4>
  <p>For Schemes that don’t have keyword arguments, the best
  approach is the one employed by Chibi's
  <code>let-keywords</code>: use a rest argument as in
  <code>(lambda (arg1 arg2 . kvs) ...​)</code>. This argument takes
  a property list of keywords and their values. Once again the
  keywords can be represented by standard Scheme symbols.</p>
  <p>Another approach would be to pass the keywords first:
  <code>(lambda (kvs arg1 arg2) ...​)</code>. This is not ideal
  since it’s really nice to be able to call a keyword procedure
  just like an ordinary procedure when you don’t supply any keyword
  arguments (i.e. they get default values). Using a rest argument
  preserves this property; using one or more preceding arguments
  does not.</p>
  <p>Using the rest argument for keywords implies that users cannot
  have their own rest argument or optional positional arguments.
  That's fine; the interplay of keywords with optional and rest
  arguments is somewhat confusing to most people anyway. And our
  keyword arguments are all optional, so a keyword argument can be
  used for any purpose an optional or rest argument might.</p>
  <p>The keyword arguments could be passed in a vector. We cannot
  do this because it’s not portable to use a vector as the rest
  argument to a procedure; it has to be a list.</p>
  <p>R<sup>5</sup>RS has the venerable
  <strong>syntax-rules</strong> pattern-matching hygienic macro
  system. It turns out to be powerful enough to implement keyword
  arguments without too much effort or duct tape. Since
  <strong>syntax-rules</strong> pattern matching is based mainly on
  list structure and we don’t have any portable keyword syntax, we
  have to rely solely on list structure to separate positional
  arguments from keyword arguments. With the ubiquitous <em>tail
  patterns</em> from SRFI 46 (<em>Basic syntax-rules
  extensions</em>) we can check whether the last element of a list
  is another list. Consequently we can achieve the syntax
  <code>(lambda/kw (pos1 pos2 (key3 key4)) ...​)</code> and
  <code>(call/kw pos1 pos2 (key3 key4))</code>. This is reasonably
  simple and unambiguous.</p>
  <h2 id="_specification">Specification</h2>
  <h3 id="_summary">Summary</h3>
  <p>This SRFI provides <strong>lambda/kw</strong> and
  <strong>call/kw</strong> which are used as follows:</p>
  <pre><code>(define foo
  (lambda/kw (a b (c d e))
    (list a b c d e)))

(foo 1 2)                        ; =&gt; (1 2 #f #f #f)
(apply foo 1 2 '())              ; =&gt; (1 2 #f #f #f)
(call/kw foo 1 2 ())             ; =&gt; (1 2 #f #f #f)
(call/kw foo 1 2 (d 4))          ; =&gt; (1 2 #f 4 #f)
(call/kw foo 1 2 (d 4 e 5))      ; =&gt; (1 2 #f 4 5)
(call/kw foo 1 2 (e 5 c 3 d 4))  ; =&gt; (1 2 3 4 5)</code></pre>
  <h3 id="_details">Details</h3>
  <p>Syntax (<strong>lambda/kw</strong> (<em>formals...​</em>
  (<em>keywords...​</em>)) <em>body...​</em>)</p>
  <p>Like <strong>lambda</strong>, but makes a procedure that can
  take keyword arguments in addition to positional arguments.</p>
  <p><em>formals</em> are zero or more identifiers naming
  positional arguments. <em>keywords</em> are zero or more
  identifiers naming keyword arguments. All positional arguments
  need to be supplied by the caller on every call. There is no way
  to define optional positional arguments or a rest argument. By
  contrast, all keyword arguments are optional. Every keyword
  argument takes on the default value <code>#f</code> when no value
  is supplied by the caller. There is no support for user-defined
  default values; this simplifies the syntax of keyword lambdas and
  makes it easier to write wrapper procedures for them since the
  wrapper can always pass <code>#f</code> to any keyword argument
  it does not use.</p>
  <p><em>body</em> is evaluated as if in the context
  (<strong>lambda</strong> (...​) <em>body...​</em>) so anything
  that can go at the beginning of a lambda can go at the beginning
  of <em>body</em>. But the lambda around <em>body</em> may be
  wrapped inside another lambda depending on the implementation.
  Within <em>body</em>, all of the arguments in <em>formals</em>
  and <em>keywords</em> can be accessed as variables using the
  identifiers given by the user.</p>
  <p>The returned procedure <em>p</em> can be called in any way
  that an ordinary procedure can, e.g. (<em>p</em>
  <em>formals...​</em>) or (<strong>apply</strong> <em>p</em>
  <em>formals</em>). If the number of arguments given to the
  procedure is equal to the number of <em>formals</em>, all keyword
  arguments take on the default value <code>#f</code>. Giving more
  arguments than that results in undefined behavior. To supply a
  value for one or more keyword arguments in a well-defined and
  portable way, call <em>p</em> via (<strong>call/kw</strong>
  <em>p</em> <em>formals</em> ...​ (<em>keyword1</em>
  <em>value1</em> ...​)). There may be additional
  implementation-defined ways to call <em>p</em>.</p>
  <p>Syntax (<strong>define/kw</strong> (<em>name</em>
  <em>formals...​</em> (<em>keywords...​</em>))
  <em>body...​</em>)</p>
  <p>Like <strong>lambda/kw</strong>, but binds the keyword lambda
  to <em>name</em> like <strong>define</strong> does.</p>
  <p>Syntax (<strong>call/kw</strong> <em>kw-lambda</em>
  <em>args</em>...​ (<em>kw-args</em>...​))</p>
  <p>This macro expands to a call to <em>kw-lambda</em> with zero
  or more positional arguments <em>args</em> and zero or more
  keyword arguments <em>kw-args</em>. It is an error to pass a
  different number of <em>args</em> than the number of positional
  arguments expected by <em>kw-lambda</em>.</p>
  <p>Keyword arguments may be passed in any combination, and in any
  order. It is an error to have duplicate keywords in
  <em>kw-args</em>. As with ordinary procedure calls in Scheme,
  nothing is guaranteed about the evaluation order of <em>args</em>
  and <em>kw-args</em>. For a guaranteed evaluation order, bind
  arguments with <strong>let</strong>* before passing them in.</p>
  <p>Each keyword argument in <em>kw-args</em> is written as two
  forms: <em>keyword</em> <em>value</em>. Each <em>keyword</em> is
  written as a standard Scheme symbol and is implicitly quoted
  (i.e. it has to be an identifier at read time; it cannot be some
  other expression that evaluates to a symbol). The symbols are
  internally converted to native keywords in implementations that
  have them.</p>
  <h2 id="_implementation">Implementation</h2>
  <p>The sample implementation covers the following Scheme
  implementations that each have their own kind of native
  keywords:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Bigloo</li>
    <li>Chicken</li>
    <li>Gambit</li>
    <li>Gauche</li>
    <li>Guile</li>

    <li>Racket</li>
    <li>S7</li>
    <li>Sagittarius</li>
    <li>STklos</li>
  </ul>
  <p>There is also a generic R<sup>5</sup>RS implementation
  (relying on SRFI 46 tail patterns). This is used as the basis of
  generic R<sup>6</sup>RS and R<sup>7</sup>RS libraries for Schemes
  that don’t have native keywords.</p>
  <p>The generic R<sup>6</sup>RS library works on the following
  Schemes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Chez Scheme</li>
    <li>Ikarus</li>
    <li>IronScheme</li>
    <li>Larceny</li>
    <li>Loko Scheme</li>
    <li>Mosh</li>
    <li>Vicare</li>

  </ul>
  <p>The generic R<sup>7</sup>RS library works on the following

  </ul>
  <h2 id="_acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h2>
  <p>Special thanks to Marc Nieper-Wißkirchen for his tireless
  championing of efficiency, hygiene and clarity on the SRFI's
  mailing list. In all Lisp systems we are aware of, keywords are
  global names: any two keywords with the same name are equal. Marc
  had the novel idea of exploring hygienic keywords so that
  keywords from different libraries would not clash, which would
  make it easier to write reliable utility libraries that add their
  own library-specific keyword arguments to procedures. Marc also
  had the idea of making <code>define/kw</code> expand to a macro
  instead of a procedure for efficiency reasons, and of using
  <em>identifier syntax</em> (familiar from R<sup>6</sup>RS
  <code>syntax-case</code> macros) to overload the macro definition
  so that using a bare identifier instead of procedure call syntax
  can still return a lambda for passing around as an object.</p>
  <p>Thanks to John Cowan for encouragement, and for working hard
  to find a way to prepare SRFI 177 for inclusion in
  R<sup>7</sup>RS Large Edition. This ultimately didn't work out,
  but very useful discussions were had and future keyword SRFIs are
  still in the cards.</p>
  <p>Thanks to Shiro Kawai for writing an optimized <a href=

  <p>Thanks to Amirouche Boubekki for balancing the discussion with
  skepticism of adding keyword arguments to Scheme at all.</p>
  <p>Thanks to John and Shiro for surveys of the native keyword
  syntax and semantics of different Scheme implementations.</p>
  <p>Thanks to many Scheme implementors and standardization people
  on the <em>srfi-discuss</em> mailing list for partaking in a big
  discussion about keyword unification in July 2019. Although the
  problem of unifying keyword syntax and semantics proved too
  complex to solve in the near future, the discussion spurred this
  SRFI to solve the most urgent problem of letting people write
  portable code.</p>
  <p>Special thanks to Robert Strandh, author of the SICL Common
  Lisp implementation, for taking the time to explain compiler
  optimization of keyword argument passing to us Schemers.</p>
  <p>Thanks to Göran Weinholt for collaborating on Docker
